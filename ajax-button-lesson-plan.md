### 1. Students Do: Bitcoins and AJAX activity (10 min)

* Objectives: The Bitcoin and AJAX activity is meant to get students comfortable working with an event listener that fires on a button click, getting a JSON API with AJAX, and displaying the JSON data in an attractive way.

* Slack out the following file and instructions to students

* **File:**

  * `bitcoin-prices-unsolved.html` and 'README.md'

* **Instructions:**

* Open the file `bitcoin-prices-unsolved.html` in your browser. Then take a few moments to see what the application does.

* There are 10 questions in the comments.  Answer each one.

### 2. Instructor Do: Bitcoins and AJAX activit (10 min)

* Take a few moments to review the Activity.  There are 10 questions students need to answer.  Your solved code has the answers.

* Have a different student answer each question while you display the unsolved code.  If they are having trouble with giving the answer, explain to them how they could find the answer.  Have another student help them if needed.

* Lastly, have at least 1 student explain how the code works - this doesn't need to be in many words, just the idea that we fire an event listener that pulls in API information and displays it in a table.

* Note: Your students might ask you about using Tables in Bootstrap.  Feel free to mention the basic way that they work, but not spend much time on this. You can also slack out this link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/

* Ask students if there are any remaining questions before moving onto the next activity.
